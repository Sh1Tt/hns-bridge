# Shaked HNS bridge

A "quick and dirty" open source alternative to hns.to
![](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/powered-by-black-magic.svg)

## How to use?

If you want to access [handshake](https://handshake.org) domain, but don't want to install additional software - you're welcome!
Just type ``<handshake-domain>.shaked.xyz`` in your browser page, and done! You're browsing handshake website!

## How to support developer?

My handshake address is ``hs1ql2pfxgenmvmzaffkf7nk6y4f65nwl37z9z0fad``, you can donate some HNS if you liked my development.
Also you can buy one of my domains: [hnsware/](https://www.namebase.io/domains/hnsware), [веб-страница/](https://www.namebase.io/domains/xn----8sbabesy3bzajl6c), [🔴💩/](https://www.namebase.io/domains/xn--ls8hvi), [💩🔴/](https://www.namebase.io/domains/xn--ls8hwi)

Thanks everyone who supports me! I need your money-support because I need to run the "main" mirror of this project (shaked.xyz itself)

## How to deploy your own bridge?

Easy! Just clone this repo, then go to the project directory, then type ``npm install`` in command line, then edit config.json as you like, point a domain to your IP, and enjoy!
